The runtime complexity of the Stack::Clear() function is O(N), which means it's worst case runtime complexity is linear. This is because the Stack class utilizes a vector, and thus the vector's clear function. This function runs through the entire structure, and destroys each element. For each additional element which is added to the stack, and thus the underlying vector, another element must be accessed and destroyed when the clear function runs.
